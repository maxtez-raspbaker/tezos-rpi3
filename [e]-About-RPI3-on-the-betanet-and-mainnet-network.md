At the moment (04/050/18) it is unclear whether the Tezos Foundation will provide instructions or support for baking on the betanet and mainnet with RPI3.

As a token holder my plan is to go forward baking with 3 RPI3. 

Detailed instructions on how to compile the Tezos program for the betanet and mainnet will be made available on these wiki pages.
About sharing a pre-compiled version, it would be probably wise to seek first some kind of endorsement or official approval from the Tezos Foundation. 
I will try to reach the TF privately, as soon as I can find a way to do it.
